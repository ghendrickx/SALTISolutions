# Neural network: Estuarine dynamics
As a by-product of the sensitivity analysis, a neural network has been trained to the elaborate data set created, 
consisting of approximately 2,000 simulations with 
[Delft3D Flexible Mesh](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/delft3d-flexible-mesh-suite/) (specifically the 
[D-Flow module](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/d-flow-flexible-mesh/)).

The neural network is accessible via a web-API that can be locally hosted by running [`api.py`](api.py). Efforts are 
made to host this web-API publicly.

## Requirements
This sub-repository has the following requirements (see also [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)):
*   `dash==2.0.0`
*   `numpy==1.19.4`
*   `pandas==1.1.4`
*   `joblib==1.0.1`
*   `Shapely==1.8.0`
*   `torch==1.9.0`
*   `plotly==5.5.0`
*   `scikit_learn==0.24.2`

For the installation of `torch`, please look at there [installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/);
the installation of `torch` is slightly different from other Python-packages for which a `pip install` suffices. Also
note that `torch` is only supported for Python 3.7-3.9, and not for Python 2.x (or 3.10).

In addition, the [`utils`](../utils)-folder is required for the functioning of the `neural_network` (i.e. the web-API).

## Usage
For the use of the web-API, [`api.py`](api.py) must be executed with Python. This provides a link to a local-host, 
which allows to use the neural network locally in a web-browser.

To use the web-API, the following steps are required:
1.  Install all the requirements (see [*Requirements*](#Requirements)).
1.  Open a Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm) or the command line.
1.  Run `api.py` (or `/neural_network/api.py`).

When running from the command line, you can either (1) first change the directory (`cd`) to the repository and 
subsequently run `api.py`; or (2) run `api.py` from any location by including the full directory to the file:
```bash
# option 1
cd path/to/repository
python neural_network/api.py
```
```bash
# option 2
python path/to/repository/neural_network/api.py
```

## Structure
The neural network and web-API are located in the folders [`machine_learning`](machine_learning) and 
[`application`](application), respectively:
```
+-- neural_network/
    +-- application/
        +-- __init__.py
        +-- app.py
        +-- components.py
    +-- machine_learning/
        +-- _data/
            +-- __init__.py

            +-- nn_scaler.gz
        +-- __init__.py

        +-- neural_network.py
    +-- __init__.py
    +-- api.py

```
