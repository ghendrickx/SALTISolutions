# SALTISolutions: Working package 7.1

## Introduction about SALTISolutions
SALTISolutions is a research consortium in which five Dutch universities are involved in collaboration with companies in
the fields related to salt intrusion. The consortium focuses on different aspects of salt intrusion and its impact on 
nature and society. The main goal is the development of a Virtual Delta that encompasses a digital twin and a serious
game. For more information, see the [website of SALTISolutions](https://kbase.ncr-web.org/saltisolutions/).

## Working package 7.1
Working package 7.1 (WP 7.1) of SALTISolutions focuses on the development of nature-based solutions to mitigate salt 
intrusion. This PhD research consists of three phases:
1.  Sensitivity analysis of salt intrusion;
1.  In-depth physical assessment(s) of nature-based solution(s);
1.  Multidisciplinary assessment of nature-based solutions.

**Phase 1: Sensitivity analysis:**
The sensitivity analysis determines the sensitivity of the salt intrusion in an estuary to thirteen variables assessed 
(three boundary conditions, and ten geometric characteristics). Due to the complexity of the physical processes 
determining salt intrusion and the scale of the analysis, machine learning techniques are used.

**Phase 2: In-depth assessment:**
Based on the sensitivity analysis of the first phase, some high-potential nature-based solutions are drawn and 
investigated in more detail.

**Phase 3: Multidisciplinary assessment:**
The _Building with Nature_-approach includes three perspectives in its assessment of nature-based solutions: 
(1) physics, (2) ecology, and (3) socio-economy. In this last phase, the ecological and socio-economical perspectives
are added to the assessment of nature-based solutions to mitigate salt intrusion.

# This repository
This repository functions as a collective overview of all work performed as part of the introduced research topic. The
result is a repository without any code, but cross-references to the standalone repositories containing products that
resulted from the research, so-called _sub-repositories_.

All code is developed on a private repository, and once ready for publication, stored in (or added to) a sub-repository.
