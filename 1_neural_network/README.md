# Estuarine dynamics: Neural network
As a by-product of the sensitivity analysis, a neural network has been trained to the elaborate data set created, 
consisting of approximately 2,000 simulations with 
[Delft3D Flexible Mesh](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/delft3d-flexible-mesh-suite/) (specifically the 
[D-Flow module](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/d-flow-flexible-mesh/)).
